                        Luffy is the protagonist of this awesome anime. He is a
                        19 year old fellow who has a dream of becoming The
                        Pirate King. His ship's name is Thousand Sunny. There
                        are total of 10 crew members, each with unique abilities

                    <p>
                        This is my favourite anime of all time. He is a citizen
                        of the Hidden Leaf village. 9 tailed fox was sealed
                        inside him when he bas born. Everyone hated him, but
                        later because of his heroic action people of his village
                        acknowleded him. He at last became the Hokake, which was
                        his life's dream.
